# Tableau-data-visualization-portfolio
Tableau portfolio featuring interactive dashboards built using SQL, Python, and real-world datasets for business analytics.

This repository showcases my end-to-end data visualization and analytics projects using **Tableau**.  
It includes basic to advanced dashboards created from real-world datasets, demonstrating skills in data cleaning, SQL querying, Python preprocessing, and business storytelling.

The goal of this portfolio is to present clear, interactive, and insightful dashboards that help drive data-driven decision-making.
